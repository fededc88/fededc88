# Hey there! My name is Federico 👋

## I'm an Electronic Engineer enchanted by microcontrollers

I've been working as Embedded Software Engineer for the last 5 years.  

I'm a beatlemanica & Rosario Central fan from 5 to 8. Ringo is my fourth favorite beatle!

📝 I'm currently teaching myself 🐍 **[python](https://github.com/fededc88/100-days-of-code)**.

🌴 In my free time you can find me hiking the appalachian trails ⛰️, racing RC cars 🚗 or playing chess ♟️. Everything well seasoned with music.
